\# PlaniFi - Personal Resource Management Platform



PlaniFi is a full-stack web application designed to help users efficiently manage their two most valuable personal resources: time and money. By integrating task organization with financial planning into a single, cohesive digital tool, PlaniFi addresses the limitations of isolated productivity apps.
